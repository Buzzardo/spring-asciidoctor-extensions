= Spring Asciidoctor Extensions

== Code block switch

Post-processes Asciidoctor's HTML output to collapse multiple code blocks into one and provides
tabs that can be used to switch between them. Requires one block that has a `role="primary"`
attribute and one more blocks that have a `role="secondary"` attribute. The tabs are named using
the block titles.

For example:

[source,indent=0]
....
[source,xml,indent=0,role="primary"]
